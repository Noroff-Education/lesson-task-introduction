# Introduction to Front-end Development
Hello and welcome to the first year of front-end development.

This is a GitHub repository and in it we can store projects and collaborate with other developers. In this particular repository, we have an introduction to the three main languages of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We have recorded a video which will hopefully pique your interest, and give you some insight into what lies ahead in your studies for first year. The video is not there to cover development in detail (we'll get to that in individual courses), but to show you the sorts of things we'll be covering.

## Task
- Download the code in this repository to your computer. You can click 'Code' and 'Download Zip'.
- Unzip the folder and double click on the index.html file. It should then open in your browser.
- Open the script.js file in a text editor. You can use something as simple as Notepad or TextEdit. Or if you have a code editor, you can open with that. The video above is coded in [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Add subjects to the 'mySubjects' array, press save, refresh your browser and see how editing the JavaScript updates the page.
- Change the values of the 'studentProfile' object to your own details. Press save and refresh the browser again, and you'll see the profile updated.
